## Introduction

YouTube playback speed controller that lets you experience more in less time. YouTubeFast, your time is valuable.

<br>
<br>

## Motivation

I've always wanted the option to watch YouTube videos faster than 2x. As a quick fix, I would manually change the speed within the dev tools, but it had to be reset constantly which I found cumbersome. There were many video speed controller extensions, but none offered privacy, a clean UI, a wide variety of settings and good compatibility with YouTube all-in-one. So, I built YouTubeFast, the NO data collecting, ZERO permission requiring YouTube playback speed controller.
